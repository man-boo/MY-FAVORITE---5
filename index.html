      <p>Dancing is my favorite hobby. Dancing makes me happy and calm. I'm always coming up with some different moves. I take dance lessons and it has helped from stage fright and I always feel confident when I walk on stage.I have been dancing since I was 6 and it has been so much fun .The person that inspired me to dance was my cousin when I saw her on stage I wanted to dance too. I love dancing, do you like to dance too? </p>

            <p>Bharathanatyam is my favorite type of dance. This indian classical dance was originated in Tamil Nadu.All Indian classical dances are to varying degrees rooted in the Natyashastra and therefore share common features: for example, the mudras (hand positions), some body positions, leg movement and the inclusion of dramatic or expressive acting or abhinaya. Indian classical music provides accompaniment and dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion. </p>
